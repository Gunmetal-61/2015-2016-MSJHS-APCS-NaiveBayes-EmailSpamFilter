Hey all,

Sorry for the late notice, but we will be having a guest speaker tomorrow during lunch in C5 (Mr. Lau's room)! His name is Henry Maltby, and he has just recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a Math major, and he will be talking briefly about "general math" with a twist on combinatorics and game theory!

Again, this is tomorrow, Thursday at lunch in C5.

See you all there!
MSJ Math

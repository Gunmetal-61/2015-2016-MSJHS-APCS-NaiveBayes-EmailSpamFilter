Dear  friend.
I got your details after an extensive on-line search Via (Network Power Charitable Trust) for a reliable person, I'm Mrs.Suzan Boni, a 57years old dying woman who was diagnosed for cancer about 4 years ago, I have decided to donate my fund ($1,000,000.00) to you for charitable goals.
I want you to use this fund to help the orphanage homes, poor, sick ones in the hospital, widows, help women with cancer, help in the church of the God ,since i do not have any child to inherit the fund.
I took this decision because I can't take this money to the grave, I don't have any child that will inherit this money, again I and my late husband vowed to use our last wealth to help the less privileged since we have no child, our relatives are wicked and selfish, they tried to frustrate our Christian life and our marriage.
Beloved I don't need telephone communication because of my health condition please reply me through my Email for me to give you other details.Proverbs19:17: He who gives to the poor lends to the lord and the lord will reward such a person for his good work. Beloved let us join hands together to help our Fellow brothers and Sister who are poor, sick and Homeless, so that blessings will be ours portion while Glory goes to the lord our creator. I am waiting for your soonest response. Thanks and God Bless You Yours Loving Sister in Christ.

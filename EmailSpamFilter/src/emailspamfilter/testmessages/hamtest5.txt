Mitchell, Catherine, Chris,

I just took a look at your presentation.  A couple suggestions for improvements.  Please forward
this to Chris as I don't have his email address.

1. On slide 3, provide an example of how naive-bayes work and how the conditional probability
    is calculated, which will help the audience understand how this machine learning algorithm
    works.  The kind of example that I gave in my tutorial slide would suffice.

2. Using O notation, explain the computational complexity of the naive bayes algorithm.  Discuss
    how your algorithm will scale to process more data.  What dimensions can data grow, which
    impacts processing time?  Refer to 13.2 of your book.

3. What is the accuracy of your classifier?  How did you test the accuracy of your classifier?
    Was it via n-fold cross validation or some other means?  Need to discuss these.

4. Expand on slide 11 to explain the shortcomings of the filter that you have built, and what
    could be done to improve it.

    A hint is that email text is only one set of attributes (or features) for machine learning.  Email
    contains many other attributes, which are mostly metadata.  Examples include Subject,
    Author (from), Recipients (to), Reply-to Address, etc... etc...  If an email comes from a
    colleague within the same company, would it more/less likely to be spam?  What if the 
    message comes from a public email service (e.g. Yahoo Mail) that anyone can sign up
    anonymously?

Your project is looking good.  This is the kind of project that college juniors in CS would do.
Make sure your audience (esp. your teacher) understands this.

Feel free to ask me questions.

Mr. Wu

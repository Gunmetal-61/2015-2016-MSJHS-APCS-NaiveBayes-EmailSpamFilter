SAT® test day is almost here. To make sure things go smoothly when you arrive at the test center:
•	Double-check the photo requirements to be certain you're using an acceptable photo.	
•	Make sure the name and date of birth on your registration match your ID.	
For the new SAT, there are a few changes. In preparation for test day, please remember the following:
•	You are allowed to use a calculator for one of the two Math sections.	
•	You now have the option to take the SAT with or without essay and make changes online up until the registration deadline. You may also make changes on test day, at the discretion of the test center supervisor, if there are available test materials, rooms, and staff.	
Contact Customer Service at least 10 days before your test date if you need to update your information.

Dear Catherine and Vivian—

I don’t know if Dr. Richmond has chosen to do this, but since you will both be working in my labs this summer, I think it might be fun for the two of you to “meet” electronically ahead of time, so this message is to both of you. I am sure you are busy with the end of school coming up, but if you have time and energy you might want to connect.

I have sent you both the same two papers and suggestions for reading them. Of course, there are others, all accessible on our group’s website. And various “crazy” projects that are underway but not published yet. So don’t be shy about asking questions and bouncing around ideas. At least one major direction (hydridic-to-protonic hydrogen bonding) that we developed some time ago grew out of an HSHSP student in 1994 being willing to take on a project that sounded a little crazy but turned out to be truly novel. We had a review article on that topic in 2001 (attached), and there’s still one outgrowth from that going on now, but our “green” chemistry efforts dominate our focus these days.

Looking forward to meeting you both—

—Ned J.

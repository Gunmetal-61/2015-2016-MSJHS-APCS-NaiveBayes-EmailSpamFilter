Dear Student,
 
You are currently projected to take Intro to C++ for fall 2016 and will need to take and pass the Ohlone math placement test in order to be eligible to receive concurrent enrollment credit.
 
Ohlone will be offering a math placement test on Wednesday, June 1 from 3-4:30 PM at Mission San Jose High in the Career Center.
 
Please reserve a seat at the link below:

If you are unable to take the math placement test on June 1 then you will need to go to the Ohlone Placement test website at http://ohlone.edu/org/placement/schedules.html and make sure to sign up and take the math placement test at one of the Ohlone campuses this summer as you MUST MEET the Ohlone math prerequisite (placement at Math 152 or 153) in order to receive concurrent enrollment credit for this course in the fall.
 
You will need to take care of this prerequisite prior to August 1 by taking the math placement test through Ohlone ASAP as students find that they do not perform as well on these tests if they wait too long after school gets out.
 
See Ms. Kim in the office if you have any questions.

Hi Vivian!

I'm excited to hear that we're labmates. I meant to get in touch with you via the HSHSP group on Facebook, but you don't seem to have a Facebook account (correct me if I'm wrong). Do you have a preferred method of communication? 

I'm from Mission San Jose High School in California, and I guess (like everyone in HSHSP) I really like science. I actually used to hope to go on a pre-med track, but now I'm looking more towards engineering/physics, which is in part why I chose this chemical engineering lab. What about you? 

Can't wait to hear from you and meet you! 

Best,

Catherine Z.

Dee,

My son submitted his online application right after receiving your message yesterday.

Is social security number needed?  He didn't know his number, and the form indicates that it is
for tax filing purpose, so he did not enter it.  We don't plan to report the class expense on our 
tax filing.  We can't add the number to the form now either.

Please let us know what we need to do.  Thank you for your help.

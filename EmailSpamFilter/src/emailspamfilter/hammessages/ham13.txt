I sent this out yesterday but for some reason it didn't go to all juniors

 

Hello juniors!

 

One day down and three to go! I have good news and bad news. The bad news first is that the minigym had connectivity issues so we had to scrap that plan. The good news is that we were able to find a new place for everyone who was supposed to test in there (bonus that you don't have to now smell that minigym stink for the next week). More good news in that as the day went on our tech team was busy at work beefing up our internet and we had basically no issues by 3rd block. Please see the time and places you will go to tomorrow. Wherever you ended up testing today (excluding the minigym) is where you will go for the rest of the week.

 

Block 1 (8am): Purple Group

Satyanarayana-Tse: B Cafeteria

Wasson-Zhuang: A cafeteria

 

Block 2 (beginning of Read): Yellow Group

Advani-Chang: B Cafeteria

Chatterjee-Chhor: Career Center

Choi-Hsu: A Cafeteria

 

Block 3 (beginning of 5th): Green Group

Hu-Leung: B Cafeteria

Li-Ma: Career Center

Maganti-Sathe: A Cafeteria

 

Note: A couple of you from Career Center were sent to A cafeteria as they were full. Go to whatever room you tested in on Monday.

 

As always, email me if you need anything. Thanks

 

Mr. Evans
